JSON  (Javascript Object Notation)

* What is it?
  JSON is a subset of javascript that lets you an object’s members and vaules as well as all of its children’s members and
  values. The values that JSON can specify are:
** a number
** a string
** a boolean (true or false)
** an array (in square brackets)
** an object (in curly braces)
** null
* Basic example of syntax
** Create an object with lots of members with curly brackets {}:
   var person = {
   “firstName” : “John”,
   “lastName”  : “Doe”,
   “height”    : “6”,
   “single”    : true,
   “pet”       : null
   }

   person.firstName --> “John”
   person.pet       -->  null
** Create an object with members and a child array with brackets [];
   var teacher = {
   “name”   : “Mr. Boss”,
   “classSize” : “20”,
   “students” : [
         “student1” : “Greg”,
         “student2” : “Jane”
   ]
   }

   teacher.name  --> “Mr. Boss”
   teacher.students[0].student1 --> “Greg”
