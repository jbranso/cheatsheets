** Objects and functions
   Suppose, you have an object declared like this
   var person = {
   height : 6,
   weight : 200,
   change : function () {
   this.height = 5;
   }
   }

   When you first make this object like this:

   var joshua = new person();

   Then Joshua starts with a height of 6. But when you call his change method:

   joshua.change();

   Joshuaâ€™s height is now 5. So,

   joshua.height will evaluate to 5.
