* Introduction
  Linus Torvalds created git to remind you how stupid you are.  In fact "git" is British slang for idiot.

  It's syntax looks like git <command> [<args>]

  You can always look up help on a specific git command with man git-<command>

** Basic commands

 - push your changes to a remote git repo
   git push

 - pulling your changes from a remote to a local git repo
   git pull

 - pulling changes from a remote repo and discarding your local changes
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/[master | tag | branch | commit-id ]
