- simple directive
  =name parameter1 parameter2 parameter3:
- block directive
  A block directive has the syntax of a simple directive, but it surrounds text with two braces "{", "}".
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  name parameter1 parameter2 {
  # more programming type text goes here
  }
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- context
  A context is a block directive that has a block directive embedded in its braces.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  events {
        name parameter1 parameter2 {

        }
  }
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Any directive not in a context is considered to be in the main context.  The events and http context reside in the main context.  While the server context is in http, and location is in server.


 Nginx can have several server blocks with each block serving content from different websites.  You can also serve different content if a client accesses your site from a specific port.
