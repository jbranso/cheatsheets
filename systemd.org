* Commands
Systemd will not execute a command as a non-root user, unless, you create a seperate instance of systemd by
following this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User
* journalctl
The systemd journal store logs produced by systemd.  It stores those logs in a binary format, so these logs can only be viewed by journalctl.  Here are some of the commands

- journalctl -b
